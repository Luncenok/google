## Future Work

This application is a powerful tool, but there are several features that could make it even better:

*   **Save/Load Sessions**: Implement a feature to save the current state (job description, CV data, user details) to a local file (e.g., a `.json` or `.pkl` file). This would allow users to manage multiple CV versions for different jobs without starting over each time.
*   **Advanced Text Editor**: Replace the standard `st.text_area` for descriptions with a rich text editor that supports basic formatting like bold, italics, and bullet points.
*   **Customizable PDF Templates**: Allow users to choose from several different PDF layouts and color schemes to personalize their final CV.
*   **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a service like Streamlit Community Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces so it can be easily accessed and shared online.
*   **Improved Error Handling**: Add more granular error handling, especially for web scraping, to guide the user if a site is difficult to parse.
*   **Direct PDF Editing**: Explore libraries that could allow for direct manipulation or annotation of the generated PDF within the app.
